%The Sequentiality Index (SqI) is is the product of two entropy measures:
% entropy of the distribution of peak activity time (Peak Entropy) and entropy of the
% spatsity of neural activity (Temporal Sparsity). The peak entropy will be maximal if the
% there is a uniform distribution of neurons whose peaks tile the entire
% delay period. One minus the sparsiity entropy will me maxminal when the activity at
% each moment comes from a single neuron. Thus SqI is maximal when the
% neural sequence is a perfect diagonal line across the entire window of
% interest with no overalap between neurons (a perfect "neural chain")
% Inputs:
% Data: a 3D matrix of neural activity in which index of trials, neurons,
% and time are in 1, 2, 3 dimension repectively
% NumEntropyBins: the number of entrpopy bins used to estimate the
% distribution of peak times and the Peak Entropy.

% Outputs:
% SqI: Sequentiality Index
% PE: Peak Entropy
% TS: mean Temporal Sparsity
